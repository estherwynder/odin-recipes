    <h2>The taste of home</h2>
    <p>This dish makes me think of home so much. It is so delicous and simple. It comforts me when I'm away and alone.</p>

<br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>4 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>water</li>
        </ul>

<br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.</li>
            <li>Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon salt. Beat eggs for a minute.</li>
            <li>Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions. Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). Add the cooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
            <li>Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
