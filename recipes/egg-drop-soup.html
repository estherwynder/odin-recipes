        <h2>Easy Homey Soup</h2>
            <p>This is so easy to make and so delicous. You can play it up and add cucumbers or cabbage or tomatoes or tofu or whatever else you want to play it up. This recipe comes from <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/egg-drop-soup/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<br>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups of chicken stock</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp of sesame oil</li>
                <li>A little bit of salt</li>
                <li>A little bit of sugar</li>
                <li>3 tbs of cornstarch (optional)</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>2 green onions</li>
            </ul>
<br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame oil, salt, and sugar. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
                <li>Next add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you'll get clumps of cooked starch in your soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. You can also add the starch in a couple small batches, let the soup simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency is to your liking.</li>
                <li>Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be lightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg). Use a ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion, and slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all.</li>
                <li>Ladle the soup into bowls, top with scallions, and serve!</li>
            </ol>
